# ECM2434-Group-Project

We are creating a new web app for students and faculty, to help remote learning and interaction between students. Students will be able to chat together on a bulletin board, and keep up to date with the latest news from university. Then, there will also be quizzes they can create and play, and other minigames to help study and have fun.

## Getting Started

These instructions will tell you what you need to run our software, and how to deploy it in a live environment.

### Prerequisites

For this software, you need to use [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/) (or an equivelant cloud service), as that is what the system is built for.
The deployment instructions are for use with IBM cloud.

### Deployment

To deploy this application...
* Sign into your IBM Cloud account
* Create a new bucket and database
* Configure the database
* Upload all the files from this repo to the bucket
* Create an API, and add new triggers and sequences - each .js file needs a corresponding GET or PUT request, depending on what the file does.

## Built With

* VS Code
* IBM Cloud
* HTML, CSS & Javascript
* Node.js
